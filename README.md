# Python-Template-Matcher
This is a template matching program written in Python and using OpenCV.

When run, this program will open up an image of a building, which is actually a single frame of a video of the building in 'building.avi'. Left click on some feature of this image and then hit spacebar. The video will then play, matching features simliar to the chosen template with red rectangles, then writing the final, template-matched video to 'output.avi'.
